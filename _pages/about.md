I'm 5-th year Ph.D candidate at Sun Yat-sen University, China. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Pengfei Chen. Currently, I am a visiting student at The University of Newcastle (advised by Prof. Hongyu Zhang). My research is in the area of intelligent software and cloud system reliability, aiming at developing intelligent and automated softwares and solutions to ensure high reliabilty of cloud systems. 

âœ¨ I'm currently on the job market. Hunting for Post-Doc/Data Scientist positions. Please feel free to reach me out via email.
