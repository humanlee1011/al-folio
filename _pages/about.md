Hi, I am 5th year Ph.D candidate in Sun Yat-sen University, advised by Pengfei Chen. I am currently a visiting student in University of NewCastle, advised by Hongyu Zhang. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Sun Yat-sen University, where I worked with Zibin Zheng. 

My research interest focus on Cloud System Reliability, mainly focus on AIOps, ensuring the high availability and reliability of cloud systems, in particular: 
- Studying the failure mechanisms, understanding the whole life cycle of failures
- data-driven Fault Diagnosis, exploring anomaly detection and fault localization methods using log, metrics, and traces data in cloud systems
